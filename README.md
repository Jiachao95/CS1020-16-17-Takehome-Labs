# CS1020-16-17-Takehome-Labs
These are my solutions for the take home labs for CS1020 in 16/17 Sem 2
These solutions are done by me and sometimes with the help of coursemates and friends.
Th solutions are intended to help those who may have trouble with the problems get started. Or if you have already completed them, this is just an alternative way to solve them.

PS: The method I use may be the best way to solve the problem sets, and there are probably more time efficient ways of solving them.
