# CS1020-16-17-Takehome-Labs
These are the take home lab questions for CS1020 in 16/17 Sem 2, the solution slides and my solutions for them.
These solutions are done by me and sometimes with the help of coursemates and friends.
These solutions are intended to help those who may have trouble with the problems get started. Or if you have already completed them, this is just an alternative way to solve them.

There are a few more problems that are yet to be done, and I will do it before the end of this Sem

PS: The method I use may be the best way to solve the problem sets, and there are probably more time efficient ways of solving them.
